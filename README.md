# Sentiment_Analysis

* This is the project which I created while completing my Coursera course named "Python Functions, Files, and Dictionaries". 
* In it we are provided three ".csv" files which we have to read and write.
* We have to define which of the tweets made are positive or negative and find the count for each of them.
* Also we have to remove punctuations from them as well.

### This project and other Python projects are built under the Python course provided by the University of Michigan.
